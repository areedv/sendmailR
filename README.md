# sendmailR
Package contains a simple SMTP client which provides a portable solution for sending email, including attachment, from within R.

## Install development version

From time to time I release development version to my private R package repository. 
To install from this repository run:

```splus
install.packages("sendmailR", repos="http://olafmersmann.github.io/drat")
```

## Install from github

To install the bleeding edge version from GitHub run (requires the `devtools`
package):

```splus
library("devtools")
install_github("olafmersmann/sendmailR")
```
